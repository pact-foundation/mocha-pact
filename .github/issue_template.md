<!-- _Thank you for reporting an issue! We appreciate it very much. Issues are a big input into the priorities for Pact development_ -->

<!-- _NOTE: If your issue is a how-to question, it is probably better asked in the pact-foundation slack channel, https://slack.pact.io/ _ -->

<!--  This is the template for issues that aren't feature requests or bug reports. If your issue is a feature request or bug report, please use the relevant  template from https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js-core/issues/new/choose - these will cover off the most common questions we ask and speed up a fix_ -->

<!-- If you're reading this thinking "Hmmm, it is bug report/feature request, but neither of those templates work for what I want to report", then please feel free to ignore the template in whatever way you think best suits your issue. We trust you, you're probably awesome -->

<!-- _Thanks again! -->
